#### Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.

#### Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.

#### Allow communication between components using props, custom events, or local store.

```
State Managed almost entirely in Vuex store which gets data from Firebase Firestore
Props used in this component https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/components/GameScores.vue
```

#### Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback.

```
signup, signin, player name input, player score input
```

#### Create a custom directive and use it on at least one of your components.

#### Use a mix of animations and transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.

```
Routes transition as a transition-group
```

#### Connect to a server using HTTP and display retrieved data (use vue-resource or Axios).

#### Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using vue-router.
