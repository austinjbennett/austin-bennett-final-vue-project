#### Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods to render large lists.

```
array.map method used in /views/Players.vue [github](https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/views/Players.vue) on line 94
array.map used in /components/RandomPlayers.vue [github](https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/components/RandomPlayers.vue) on line 51
array.reduce used in /components/PlayerScores.vue [github](https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/components/PlayerScores.vue) on line 54

#### Encapsulate your code as VueJS single-file components.

#### Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.

#### Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.

#### Allow communication between components using props, custom events, or local store.

```
State Managed almost entirely in Vuex store which gets data from Firebase Firestore
Props used in this component https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/components/GameScores.vue
```

#### Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback.

```
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/signup,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/signin,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/players name input (at least 2 characters),
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/games/:gameId score input (must be a number)
```

#### Create a custom directive and use it on at least one of your components.

#### Use a mix of animations and transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.

```
Routes transition

```

#### Connect to a server using HTTP and display retrieved data (use vue-resource or Axios).

```
Axios used in /components/RandomPlayers.vue [github](https://github.com/skaduusch/austin-bennett-final-vue-project/blob/master/src/components/RandomPlayers.vue) on line 48
```

#### Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using vue-router.

```
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/home,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/players,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/games,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/signIn,
https://austinb-vue-final.netlify.com/signUp
```

#### Manage your application's state using vuex.
